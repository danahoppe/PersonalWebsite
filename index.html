        <p>
            I am a creative interested in Computer Science, Philosophy, 
            Art and how it all fits together. I am a volunteer who 
            believes education is the key to changing the world. I am 
            interested in synthesizing the old with the new. I believe 
            that the most important problem to solve is the problem solving 
            process itself. And the solution lies at the intersection of 
            Computational, Logical, Critical, and Creative Thinking. 
            Innovative problem solving requires more than information, it 
            requires pattern recognition, abstraction, logical reasoning, 
            generalization, creativity, and inspiration to know how to 
            effectively organize, process, interpret, and utilize 
            information for a given purpose. And the given purpose is a 
            problem to solve in its own right - ethically, politically, 
            and philosophically.

        There is a proverb attributed to Solon, the forefather of Athenian democracy, 
        which is quoted by Socrates many times throughout the Platonic dialogues – ‘χαλεπὰ τὰ καλά’ – 
        which translates roughly to – ‘beautiful things are difficult’. Throughout my studies at the 
        University of Nebraska, Lincoln, I have learned a great deal, but there is nothing that struck 
        true for me quite like this saying. 
    </p>
    <p>
        From a family of painters and sculptors, I grew up with a heavy emphasis on 
        creativity. Imagination and curiosity took root and I thought to myself – 
        “what is going on here?” Somehow that question led me to Physics and Philosophy. 
        When college came, though initially undecided, I enrolled as a Physics student. 
        The artist in me was still there, however, and the artist desired to create something beautiful. 
        I found myself at an impasse, unable to choose between Science / Technology and Creativity / Art. 
        The philosopher in me was still there, however, and the philosopher wondered whether these seemingly 
        opposing areas could not be reconciled. So, with zero prior experience, I became a Computer Scientist,
         because the computer stood out to me as a tool at the forefront of technological innovation and imbued
          with unlimited creative potential.

        The journey from that point forward was extremely challenging, confusing, and full of failures. I knew 
        I loved programming when I wrote my first real Java program, and object-oriented programming began to click,
         painting when I completed my first master copy, and logical reasoning when I wrote my 
         first Philosophy paper. But most importantly, 
         I knew that what I truly loved was problem solving – creating solutions.
          And as I began to learn about the design and analysis of algorithms, 
          NP completeness, and Boolean satisfiability, I realized that Computer Science was 
          the most powerful domain for solving problems. More importantly, I began to weave 
          a thread between the areas I was studying. Problem decomposition, abstraction, 
          pattern recognition, generalization, and imagination are not only central to Computational 
          Thinking, but also Creative Thinking and Philosophical Reasoning. And this is beautiful.

        No human is an island, and throughout the struggle of academia, the relationships I built with
         others shaped my experience and taught me many valuable lessons. I found that in addition to asking pro
         for help, my peers often served as the best resource for figuring out solutions and sharing knowledge. 
         By working with others to solve problems, I began to understand the value of teamwork and discovered a
          passion for sharing my knowledge with others. I began to mentor students as a teaching assistant, teach
           robotics and drones to middle schoolers, and developed Creative Coding curriculum to share my vision. Later, as a Raikes
            Associate in Design Studio, I realized the complexity of maintaining productivity, communication, 
            and professionality among team members, coaches, and sponsors during the software development process.
             Successful leadership is a worthy problem itself that I found was often solved through empathy, humility, respect, open communication, and dedication. 
        Problem solving, creating something new, learning, teaching, and leadership are all difficult, yet beautiful things. And there is something very beautiful even in the difficulty itself. Because someone will only apply the effort and struggle towards a purpose if they truly believe in its worth.
