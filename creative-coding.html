            Rising enrollments in Computer Science pose an opportunity to engage students from
diverse backgrounds and interests; and a challenge to deliver on positive learning outcomes.
While student engagement is the driving factor for increased learning performance and retention,
it has been declining to new lows for Computer Science students in recent years. In order to
further explore the potential of contextualized computing as a tool for increasing engagement in
computing and developing Computational Thinking aptitude in students, we have developed an
introductory computing course contextualized with Art and Design with modules centered
around guiding pedagogical principles and aimed at middle school and high school students.
This Creative Coding course utilizes a principle and theory-based approach in its design in order
to meet the pedagogical goals of this project. Additionally, we have developed data collection
tools for analyzing the effectiveness of the course in increasing student engagement and
Computational Thinking aptitude. Results coming from limited implementation at two sites
suggests that with future implementation, data collection, and material refinement, Creative
Coding can serve as a flexible tool for increasing student engagement and as a basis for further
research into contextualized computing.
