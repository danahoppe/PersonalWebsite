        <p>
            I am a creative interested in Computer Science, Philosophy, 
            Art and how it all fits together. I am a volunteer who 
            believes education is the key to changing the world. I am 
            interested in synthesizing the old with the new. I believe 
            that the most important problem to solve is the problem solving 
            process itself. And the solution lies at the intersection of 
            Computational, Logical, Critical, and Creative Thinking. 
            Innovative problem solving requires more than information, it 
            requires pattern recognition, abstraction, logical reasoning, 
            generalization, creativity, and inspiration to know how to 
            effectively organize, process, interpret, and utilize 
            information for a given purpose. And the given purpose is a 
            problem to solve in its own right - ethically, politically, 
            and philosophically.
